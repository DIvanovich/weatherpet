When should you go for a walk? For example, your pet needs walking... 
This is a single-page react application. It gives recommendations on what to wear and what weather is expected outside. 
It uses API access to get data from the server "openweathermap.org". 
It is possible to type a name of a city to determine the weather accurately.
A set of icons in the form of umbrellas, showing the power of the wind, was created. The temperature is taken into account too. 
Cloudiness, precipitation, and time of day are taken into account to determine the conforming background photo with the dog, which wants to walk :). 
The application shows errors if they arise upon receipt of data.
